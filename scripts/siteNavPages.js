      "Buy Feminized Marijuana Seeds - Feminized marijuana seeds are the result of a scientific process meant to produce only female seeds. The process involves forcing female plants to produce pollen sacs which are then used to pollinate other female marijuana plants. When a female plant is forced to produce pollen sacs, it can be expected that the pollen coming out of it will have female genes and when matched with another female, then it will have the natural tendency to produce only female seeds.",
