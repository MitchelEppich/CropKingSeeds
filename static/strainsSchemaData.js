Now, I have 12 plants going with proper lighting and ventilation, 3 from the CKS autofem mix. The CKS autofem plants have far tighter internodes and vigorous, healthy growth than the others from other breeders. If my LST goes well, I'm hoping to squeeze 1 oz. per plant out of those 12 plants in a 4x4. I know it's a crazy number of plants in there, but I think I can squeeze 1 oz each, if I keep the CalMag flowin' because of the LED's. That would be lovely!

After visiting with the lady she said she was sending me some Crown Royal seeds free of charge. For my inconvenience. I was really impressed with the offer.

I dropped one in a homemade DWC tub and rigged it up under an early generation 90 watt LED UFO, about 3 feet above the plant... in my bathroom. I had grown a few times in soil, but I just wanted to see how hydro works. I hardly took care of her, and with very little light, that lady ended up giving me 1.5 oz of amazing, frosty, tasty, dried sativa bud!! I smoke Northern Cali medicals exclusively, and this was amazing... maybe because the genetics were a little bit different or something. And that seed just BLEW UP with very little care. Now, I have 12 plants going with proper lighting and ventilation, 3 from the CKS autofem mix. The CKS autofem plants have far tighter internodes and vigorous, healthy growth than the others from other breeders. If my LST goes well, I'm hoping to squeeze 1 oz. per plant out of those 12 plants in a 4x4. I know it's a crazy number of plants in there, but I think I can squeeze 1 oz each, if I keep the CalMag flowin' because of the LED's. That would be lovely! All personal :) My next grow will be all CKS, no doubt. I went ahead and set up a Bitcoin wallet so I can order easier in the US.

I have had 95 and 98% success rate with germination. I have a lighthouse tent with a 400LED light system. The plants range from 24 inch to 36 inch in height and harvests three-quarter ounce to 1 1/4 ounce per plat. The plants have always butted in 4 to 6 weeks and harvest can be done at eight weeks but it is better to go 10 to 12 for maximum THC content. I must impress upon anyone who is trying to grow these the less you mess with them the better they grow. I just put my plants in miracle grow dirt and water 20 to 24 ounces on each plant per day the containers are about 1 gallon but that said the best thing that I found throw them in his paper bags. You must understand when you are growing auto flower. The less you mess with them the better. The soil to plant them in we'll have enough fertilizer and nutrients to sustain them for the 10 weeks to 12 weeks. I have found that I have in dry weight after each planting approximately 1/2 pound the three-quarter pounds every three months. Larger pots, fertilizer, messing with the pH, did not change the harvest. The harvest is genetically set and there is not much you can do to increase what is going on in the short period of time that they have to grow. They are excellent for people who just want to get A different variety of smoke and all the different flavors. People state their complaint is they don't not know what is in or what kind of seeds they are. I am an old hippie from the 60s and at this point my life it's all about the taste and the quality of the high. Who cares about what kind it is.all I can say is if you're thinking about picking up auto flower they're great they're fast and they're not a whole lot of hassle.most anyone who wishes to offset the cost and door the hassle of getting your smoke this is the best way to do it. But the most important thing about growing your own is \"do not let anyone know you are growing. Repeat do not let anyone know you are growing.\" That all said I really enjoy the auto flowers , The different flavors and tastes and varieties are exciting to me. For me I have learned if you keep the proper lighting the proper watering and the proper ventilation and let them go you will end up being a happy camper with your harvest .... hang in there from the old guy from the 60s...

All the same height (+/- 3 inches), all the same growth speed, all the same size, all the same level of stretch and they all finished on the same exact day (at 62 days from 12/12, they all started showing amber trichomes). Yields were 10.25oz, 7,75 oz and 9.8 oz. All had the same exact light, wind, nutes, media, everything. Toppped the same, lollipopped the same. The plants were extremely healthy and vigorous. All of them grew very slow in veg, as is typical for BK. Two made slightly airy buds (a bit sativa-like in appearance), one made rocks. Biggest stems I've ever produced. Actually had to use a saw to cut the trunks, which were about 4 inches in diameter (36 inch plants). The LST combined with a strong wind made them able to support themselves until the end, save for three of four branches on one of the plants, that I just tied to the trunk. Two are pretty strong, slightly above average, the other with the CBD cuts the THC effect a bit. One tastes like a typical BK, one tastes a bit like fuel, and the other tastes like the leather jacket of an old man who smokes (it really does, it's very special). One makes your heart race and is almost a sativa, then becomes narcotic after about thirty minutes. One is like taking muscle relaxants. One is just very, very calm. Almost like I meditated. All of them are really smooth and tasty to smoke. The best method to grow these is a SOG. Slow veg, little stretch, rigid baseball bats for stems. Growing them more that 3 feet high is just wasting energy. The leaves are huge, extremely abundant and very thick./&=>4/&=>Fri Feb 08 2019 10:39:18 GMT-0800"],"ratingQuantity":[0,0,0,2,3],"releaseDate":"2018-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","moreInfo":["As a member of the Kush family, Bubba Kush is one of the more widely known strains you can get your hands on today.This easy to moderate grow thrives both indoors and outdoors and typically completes flowering in just 9 short weeks.This Indica grows bushy plants that produce huge, dense, and sticky buds.","The THC content of our Bubba Kush is 17.79 %, and CBD content is 1.20 %.This offspring of the classics Bubble Gum and Original Kush can produce yields weighing up to 500 g indoors and 300 g indoors.These are extremely large numbers, which are what you definitely want in your grow area.","The effect of this strain is best described as a relaxing full - body high.It will glue you to your bed for hours on end, letting your mind freely wander as you savor the sweet earthy flavors of Bubba Kush.The scent is a unique combination of the sweet and the downright pungent.From the smell to the aftertaste, there is nothing not to like about this plant.","This strain has medicinal properties as well.Medical weed patients turn to Bubba Kush for relief from various kinds of pain and remedy for insomnia.That sought- after body buzz that this strain is known for never fails to relax the mind and body to make rest and sleep easier to get.With so many individuals having such problems these days, having Bubba Kush ready in jars should benefit both you and your friends.","All Kush strains are always a good bet.Bubba Kush is a nice addition to your garden because it is a sure winner and has numerous benefits that should sit well with both recreational and medical marijuana users.This is also a good option particularly if you are looking for a strain with large yields and easy to moderate growing requirements."],"_id":"5c267c7f7a337f53cca110ca","name":"Bubba Kush Feminized Cannabis Seeds","strainImg":"/plant/BKF.png","packageImg":"/packages/BKF.png","description":"Warm up to a long-lasting Indica with this classic Kush strain.

They grew in a great environment with the same super-soil and about 7500 lu/sq ft... (hps) in 5 gallon containers... about 75deg the whole time. Harvested 65 days from germination and got about 2 oz per plant dried. Plants were about 32\" at harvest. I have two growing in a super-soil planter in the back yard and am starting to germ the last two for a warmer experience in the same. I planted a bit early and staved off a couple of hard frosts by covering and ended up with a lot of cloud cover so this round is not ideal. they are flowering and look like twins, each has 10-15 gallons of root space if not more. I use it to make oil/caplets for a terminally ill ma-in-law and the combo of CBD/THC is really effective. Others really enjoy it as well... relaxing with mild high.. can function like normal but kills pain effectively. I will grow it again this fall. We can increase size and harvest by adding metal halide or LED during veg and 7gal grow bags. Harder to clone due to early flowering... not sure any will develop into useful plants.

What 'regular' means is that all of these seeds are a mixture of both male and female. When they are grown, the males have to be separated so that they do not pollinate the females. If they are left together and pollinate, you'll have a bunch of seeds produced with no flowers made. So if your growing marijuana for producing flower to be used, its important to separate the plants once they start growing.
