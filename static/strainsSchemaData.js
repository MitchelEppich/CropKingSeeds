I dropped one in a homemade DWC tub and rigged it up under an early generation 90 watt LED UFO, about 3 feet above the plant... in my bathroom. I had grown a few times in soil, but I just wanted to see how hydro works. I hardly took care of her, and with very little light, that lady ended up giving me 1.5 oz of amazing, frosty, tasty, dried sativa bud!! I smoke Northern Cali medicals exclusively, and this was amazing... maybe because the genetics were a little bit different or something. And that seed just BLEW UP with very little care. Now, I have 12 plants going with proper lighting and ventilation, 3 from the CKS autofem mix. The CKS autofem plants have far tighter internodes and vigorous, healthy growth than the others from other breeders. If my LST goes well, I'm hoping to squeeze 1 oz. per plant out of those 12 plants in a 4x4. I know it's a crazy number of plants in there, but I think I can squeeze 1 oz each, if I keep the CalMag flowin' because of the LED's. That would be lovely! All personal :) My next grow will be all CKS, no doubt. I went ahead and set up a Bitcoin wallet so I can order easier in the US.

I expected the \"haze\" to have much longer internodes, but so far it hasn't, so I hope I can keep it under control during flowering because it's growing in a raised bed with 5-foot hoop tunnel of floating row cover to screen it from neighbors and protect it from insects and deer./&=>4/&=>Fri Feb 08 2019 12:52:58 GMT-0800"],"ratingQuantity":[0,0,0,2,3],"releaseDate":"2018-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","_id":"5c2a813304a40e21e0d18129","name":"Super Silver Haze Feminized Cannabis Seeds","strainImg":"/plant/SHF.png","packageImg":"/packages/SHF.png","description":"The only strain that has won back to back Cannabis Cups has been bottled up and cloned for everyone to have access to.

The fifth one germinated, but never surfaced, I think it was a bit too deep. 1 trileaf mutant and 3 regular plants. The mutant was eliminated because it was half the size of the others by week 6 of veg. 3 completely different phenos. 1 actually looks, smells and tastes like Bubba Kush. 1 looks and smells like a fat and hairy Northern Lights, 1 is a bit like a Mazar (?!) and obviously has a lot of CBD (it's a strong anxiolitic). I got 27.8 oz (bit too dry) under 1000W, 50 day veg, topped once, LST, 7 gallon fabric pots, coco. I could've done better. I used a two-part coco fert that forced me to overfeed N in flowering (got burns all over one plant), and then underfeeding to avoid the N excess. I also treated the coco like dirt, watering only every 3-4 days. No defoliation. This is the least stable strain I've ever grown, and it should have been extremely stable. This is supposed to be an old strain. Every plant should be almost the same. It was like I had three different strains, both in structure of buds, taste and potency. One didn't eat, another was a glutton and one was in between. One liked it hot, one liked it cold. I must say however that they were homogenous in growth. All the same height (+/- 3 inches), all the same growth speed, all the same size, all the same level of stretch and they all finished on the same exact day (at 62 days from 12/12, they all started showing amber trichomes). Yields were 10.25oz, 7,75 oz and 9.8 oz. All had the same exact light, wind, nutes, media, everything. Toppped the same, lollipopped the same. The plants were extremely healthy and vigorous. All of them grew very slow in veg, as is typical for BK. Two made slightly airy buds (a bit sativa-like in appearance), one made rocks. Biggest stems I've ever produced. Actually had to use a saw to cut the trunks, which were about 4 inches in diameter (36 inch plants). The LST combined with a strong wind made them able to support themselves until the end, save for three of four branches on one of the plants, that I just tied to the trunk. Two are pretty strong, slightly above average, the other with the CBD cuts the THC effect a bit. One tastes like a typical BK, one tastes a bit like fuel, and the other tastes like the leather jacket of an old man who smokes (it really does, it's very special). One makes your heart race and is almost a sativa, then becomes narcotic after about thirty minutes. One is like taking muscle relaxants. One is just very, very calm. Almost like I meditated. All of them are really smooth and tasty to smoke. The best method to grow these is a SOG. Slow veg, little stretch, rigid baseball bats for stems. Growing them more that 3 feet high is just wasting energy. The leaves are huge, extremely abundant and very thick./&=>4/&=>Fri Feb 08 2019 10:39:18 GMT-0800"],"ratingQuantity":[0,0,0,2,3],"releaseDate":"2018-06-01T07:00:00.000Z","_id":"5c267c7f7a337f53cca110ca","name":"Bubba Kush Feminized Cannabis Seeds","strainImg":"/plant/BKF.png","packageImg":"/packages/BKF.png","description":"Warm up to a long-lasting Indica with this classic Kush strain.

Three of five seeds germinated and all three phenos were quite different. (Much respect to Crop King for the free replacement seeds, however!) The best pheno has firm buds with many pistils (hairs). The Purple Kush was slow to start, hard to clone and relatively hard to grow, showing some yellow leaves and a slow start in veg. All three examples finished at almost seventy days in flower. The cured smoke is quite strong - altho I somehow expected a bit more. Only one plant developed purple colors toward the end of flower but the buds were light and airy.

The frost covered the budds and leaves with average density and was true to it's 9-10 week budding estimate. The budding box remained at a constant 30-40% humidity, the temp was from 15 deg Cel during it's daytime off period and up to a max of 24 deg Cel during it's lights on time at night.

I have no idea what the strain was but it finished late october and turned out great. I wish I knew what it was!!! I did complain after week 10 and cropking sent me 5 new seeds, I grew 3 seeds this year. All three germinated. And it was definitely cbd auto cheese I grew them outdoors in eastern ontario in 10 gal containers. They grew quick and I experimented. One I left to grow untouched. one I FIMed and one I cut the lower branches off. The one left untouched did the best. The one FIMed got about 2/3 the yeild of the one untouched and the last one was similar but formed a huge main cola. No rot issues. I started early July and finished mid September. It's now cured and it is very very smooth and enjoyable to smoke. The potency is quite low. This is a very functionable buzz great for social settings. It doesn't last very long however.

DOWTY/&=>customer@cks.com/&=> I bought the Cheese in January or so and initially planted 3 seeds (two of which I did not think would germinate (chipped/deformed a bit)... but they did. Weird that all three plants grew differently ie looked like they had different genetic traits in some ways ie plant shape and bud formation. They grew in a great environment with the same super-soil and about 7500 lu/sq ft... (hps) in 5 gallon containers... about 75deg the whole time. Harvested 65 days from germination and got about 2 oz per plant dried. Plants were about 32\" at harvest. I have two growing in a super-soil planter in the back yard and am starting to germ the last two for a warmer experience in the same. I planted a bit early and staved off a couple of hard frosts by covering and ended up with a lot of cloud cover so this round is not ideal. they are flowering and look like twins, each has 10-15 gallons of root space if not more. I use it to make oil/caplets for a terminally ill ma-in-law and the combo of CBD/THC is really effective. Others really enjoy it as well... relaxing with mild high.. can function like normal but kills pain effectively. I will grow it again this fall. We can increase size and harvest by adding metal halide or LED during veg and 7gal grow bags. Harder to clone due to early flowering... not sure any will develop into useful plants.

Known for smaller dense buds and moderate-sized harvests Haze Xtreme will give you a body and head high allowing you to excel at daily activities while maintaining creative conversations. These are regular Haze Xtreme cannabis seeds. What that means is that all of these seeds are a mixture of both male and female. When you grow them, the males should be separated from the females so that they do not pollinate. If they are kept together and pollinate, you'll have a bunch of seeds produced with no flowers. When growing marijuana for making a usable flower, it's important to keep the plants separate once they start growing. Telling the difference between male and female plants is as easy as checking the preflowers when they grow. A 'pre-flower' is when the plants start to flower the males will produce preflowers that are 'ball' shaped and the females will produce preflowers that are 'pistil' shaped. Haze Xtreme is mostly sativa and can reach up to 10 weeks to flower. The effect is awesome with a body and head high which will leave you awake so this is not good for a night smoke. This is fit for those who want to keep active and productive with their day-to-day activities.

I dropped one in a homemade DWC tub and rigged it up under an early generation 90 watt LED UFO, about 3 feet above the plant... in my bathroom. I had grown a few times in soil, but I just wanted to see how hydro works. I hardly took care of her, and with very little light, that lady ended up giving me 1.5 oz of amazing, frosty, tasty, dried sativa bud!! I smoke Northern Cali medicals exclusively, and this was amazing... maybe because the genetics were a little bit different or something. And that seed just BLEW UP with very little care. Now, I have 12 plants going with proper lighting and ventilation, 3 from the CKS autofem mix. The CKS autofem plants have far tighter internodes and vigorous, healthy growth than the others from other breeders. If my LST goes well, I'm hoping to squeeze 1 oz. per plant out of those 12 plants in a 4x4. I know it's a crazy number of plants in there, but I think I can squeeze 1 oz each, if I keep the CalMag flowin' because of the LED's. That would be lovely!

I have had 95 and 98% success rate with germination. I have a lighthouse tent with a 400LED light system. The plants range from 24 inch to 36 inch in height and harvests three-quarter ounce to 1 1/4 ounce per plat. The plants have always butted in 4 to 6 weeks and harvest can be done at eight weeks but it is better to go 10 to 12 for maximum THC content. I must impress upon anyone who is trying to grow these the less you mess with them the better they grow. I just put my plants in miracle grow dirt and water 20 to 24 ounces on each plant per day the containers are about 1 gallon but that said the best thing that I found throw them in his paper bags. You must understand when you are growing auto flower. The less you mess with them the better. The soil to plant them in we'll have enough fertilizer and nutrients to sustain them for the 10 weeks to 12 weeks. I have found that I have in dry weight after each planting approximately 1/2 pound the three-quarter pounds every three months. Larger pots, fertilizer, messing with the pH, did not change the harvest. The harvest is genetically set and there is not much you can do to increase what is going on in the short period of time that they have to grow. They are excellent for people who just want to get A different variety of smoke and all the different flavors. People state their complaint is they don't not know what is in or what kind of seeds they are. I am an old hippie from the 60s and at this point my life it's all about the taste and the quality of the high. Who cares about what kind it is.all I can say is if you're thinking about picking up auto flower they're great they're fast and they're not a whole lot of hassle.most anyone who wishes to offset the cost and door the hassle of getting your smoke this is the best way to do it. But the most important thing about growing your own is \"do not let anyone know you are growing. Repeat do not let anyone know you are growing.\" That all said I really enjoy the auto flowers , The different flavors and tastes and varieties are exciting to me. For me I have learned if you keep the proper lighting the proper watering and the proper ventilation and let them go you will end up being a happy camper with your harvest .... hang in there from the old guy from the 60s...

Repeat customers usually germinate a number of seeds so that they can find a special mother plant which is really easy to take cuttings from. It yields good and primarily liked for those who are looking for that special, relaxing and refined high. These are regular blueberry cannabis seeds. What that means is that all of these seeds are a mixture of both male and female. When you grow them, the males should be separated from the females so that they do not pollinate. If they are kept together and pollinate, you'll have a bunch of seeds produced with no flowers. So if your growing marijuana for producing a usable flower, it's important to separate the plants once they start growing. The way to tell the difference between male and female plants is when the plants start to flower the males will produce preflowers that are 'ball' shaped and the females will produce preflowers that are 'pistil' shaped. Blueberry is an easy variety to grow but can be a choosy feeder. However, the payoffs for your efforts and investments are high yield harvests of tasty and high-quality buds.
